# StartPHP

In this study the Laravel and Symfony software frameworks were evaluated and 
compared, and the comparative results were utilized to design the creation of a new version of 
the StartPHP software framework. 

All three frames are free, open source and built on the model-view-controller architectural pattern. 

A unique model for comparing and assessing the Laravel 
and Symfony programming frameworks was also created. Popularity, system requirements, 
technical architecture, code organization, architecture concepts, and documentation are the 
categories we used to evaluate the two program frameworks. 

Each of these groups has its own 
set of criteria. The StartPHP program framework, which was constructed as part of the diploma 
project, was presented in the second part of this study, and it was compared to the other two 
software frameworks. After comparing the StartPHP framework with the Symfony and Laravel 
frameworks, a detailed development plan for the next version of the StartPHP framework was 
developed. The announced plan for the development of the next version includes the 
improvement of documentation and installation, security patches such as forging requests from 
another site and adding a new object-relational mapping system.
